* What's LLVMRuby

LLVMRuby is a set of bindings making the LLVM compiler infrastructure 
(http://llvm.org) usable from Ruby.  This extention allows using LLVM
as an abstract assembler and reflects a good chunk of the LLVM class
hierarchy into Ruby.  Included is an example of using this to build
a simple JIT compiler, written entirely in Ruby, which is able to 
interact with the native Ruby 1.8/1.9 data types.

* How to build

You must get and build LLVM separately, available for download at:

  http://llvm.org/releases  

Make sure that you configure LLVM with PIC enabled:
  
  $ ./configure --enable-pic

Add the llvm bin directory to your path, extconf needs to be able to find llvm-conf:

  $ export PATH=$PATH:/$LLVMDIR/Debug/bin

Once you have built LLVM, run extconf.rb giving it location of LLVM:

  $ ruby extconf.rb --with-llvm-include=/$DIR/llvm/include --with-llvm-lib=/$DIR/llvm/Debug/lib

Run make

  $ make

Run the tests (you will need Rake installed)

  $ rake test

Look in test.rb to see examples of use and start messing around.

* Caveats

I created this using very latest LLVM (from svn, soon to be 2.4).  Other 
versions may not work.  I have been trying to get the 2.3 released package 
to work, only one conditional typedef is required, but it complaining about 
fPIC stuff :(

I have only been using this on 64bit machines.  I know for a fact that
the example JIT assumes that you are using 64bit Ruby.  These should
be quite easy to change in the Ruby code, but I have no machine to 
test that on.

* Things that definitely do not work right now

No attempt has been made to properly free LLVM objects.  This probably
isn't hard, LLVM api has easy to deal with memory management.  Many LLVM
objects end up owned by modules/execution engine and shouldn't be freed
normally anyway.

There needs to be a lot more exception raising when arguments are of wrong
number/type and need to try/catch around c++ calls and turn exception into
Ruby exceptions.
