* What's LLVMRuby

LLVMRuby is a set of bindings making the LLVM compiler infrastructure 
(http://llvm.org) usable from Ruby.  This extention allows using LLVM
as an abstract assembler and reflects a good chunk of the LLVM class
hierarchy into Ruby.  Included is an example of using this to built
a simple JIT compiler, written entirely in Ruby, which is able to 
interact with the native Ruby 1.8/1.9 data types.

* How to build

You must get and build LLVM seperately, available for download at:

  http://llvm.org/releases  

Add the llvm bin directory to your path, extconf needs to be able to find llvm-conf:

  $ export PATH=$PATH:/$LLVMDIR/Debug/bin

Once you have built LLVM, run extconf.rb giving it location of LLVM:

  $ ruby extconf.rb --with-llvm-include=/$DIR/llvm/include --with-llvm-lib=/$DIR/llvm/Debug/lib

Run make

  $ make

Look in test.rb to see examples of use and start messing around.

* Caveats

I created this for version 2.3 of LLVM.  Other versions may not work.
I have only been using this on 64bit machines.  I know for a fact that
the example JIT assumes that you are using 64bit Ruby.  These should
be quite easy to change in the Ruby code, but I have no machine to 
test that on.
